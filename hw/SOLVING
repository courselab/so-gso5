    d) Yes, outpus are idential. Thay is expected sice we are converting a assembly code to a x86 architecture. So, instructions should be very similar, close to identical.

    e) They are similar, but not identical. Since it was written in a different assembly language, it's possible to spot few differences when disassembling through another tool.

    f) Yes. Code has successfully booted in QEMU. The following text can be seen.

    i) Comparing hw2.bin with eg.bin, there are some differences, mainly on their memory positions. hw.bin have more defined memory positions than hw2.bin.
        As for their instructions, they still very similar, with differences only in jmp instruction.
